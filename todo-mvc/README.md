# My TODO MVC using flux

# Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
# open index.html
```

# Watch

Instead of manually building after each change it's possible to automatically recompile the javascript bundle when files change:

```bash
npm run watch
# make javascript changes, then refresh index.html
```
